> [!WARNING]
> For platform compatibility reasons, the type structure visible in usage is different from the sturcture in code and most of the helpers are designed for access via the @Axinom.Toolkit.Helpers class! Always use `Helpers.Argument.ValidateIsNotNull()` style to access helper methods even if they are defined in other types!

You will find the majority of the extension methods documented under the @Axinom.Toolkit.NetStandardHelpers and @Axinom.Toolkit.NetFrameworkHelpers classes.
