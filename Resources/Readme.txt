Branches
========

* development - do the main work here (or make a feature branch off this branch).
* master - commit finished work here to cause VSTS to publish new NuGet packages. Remember to increment versions numbers first.

Tests
=====

Use Test.cmd in the solution root to run tests (the UWP test project does not work via the Visual Studio runner).
